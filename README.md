# Algorithm Implementations in Python and C

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms in Python and C. It currently includes the implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm, and more algorithms will be added in the future.

## Implemented Algorithms

- **Merge Sort**: An efficient sorting algorithm that uses the "divide and conquer" technique to sort a list of elements.

  More algorithms will be available soon.

## Repository Structure

- `/python`: Contains implementations of algorithms in Python.
- `/c`: Contains implementations of algorithms in C.
- `/others`: Space for possible implementations in other languages in the future.

## How to Run the Algorithms

Detailed instructions are provided in each language-specific folder on how to execute the algorithms.
